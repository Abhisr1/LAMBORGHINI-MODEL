# Project Title

 LAMBERGINI 2D DESING MODEL BY USING AUTOCAD SOFTWERE

# Description
The Lamborghini project is a high-performance luxury car that embodies cutting-edge engineering and design. We can start by sketching the outline of the car's profile, incorporating key features like the distinct shape of the body, the positioning of the wheels, and other defining characteristics. Additionally, make sure to include accurate measurements and dimensions to ensure precision. Utilize AutoCAD's line, circle, and arc tools to create the detailed 2D representation of the Lamborghini car project
